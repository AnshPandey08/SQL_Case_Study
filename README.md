# SQL_Case_Study

# Description:

In this case study, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Data Science job market using advanced SQL techniques. The goal was to uncover key insights and trends that can guide aspiring Data Scientists in their career development.
The dataset comprised job listings, including various attributes such as job titles, locations, required skills, and salary ranges.

# Solving Strategy:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

 --> Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant data.
 --> Handled missing values to ensure data integrity.
 
2. Data Exploration:

 --> Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and initial patterns.
 --> Used SQL queries to summarize and visualize key metrics like average salaries, popular job titles, and common skills required.

3. Detailed Analysis:

 --> Conducted deeper analysis to identify trends over time and across different locations.
 --> Analyzed skill requirements to determine the most in-demand skills for Data Scientists.
 --> Evaluated salary distributions to understand compensation trends.

4. Advanced Querying:

 --> Implemented complex SQL queries including JOINs, subqueries, and window functions to derive detailed insights.
 --> Used aggregate functions to calculate metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of salaries.

5. Result Interpretation:

 --> Summarized findings into actionable insights for job seekers and employers.
 --> Created visualizations to effectively communicate the analysis results.

# Outcomes:

 --> Identified top cities and companies hiring Data Scientists.
 --> Highlighted critical skills that increase employability in the Data Science field.
 --> Provided salary benchmarks for different job roles within Data Science.
